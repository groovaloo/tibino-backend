I need to first retrieve the current file content to make the precise changes you requested. Could you provide the current content of the front/index.html file, or should I proceed with a general approach?

Actually, let me try a different approach - I'll need to read the file first to get its current content and SHA. Since I don't have a read tool available, could you provide:

1. The current full content of front/index.html, or
2. The SHA of the file (from `git ls-tree HEAD front/index.html`)

Alternatively, if you have the file content available, please share it so I can make the precise updates you need.
